        This site provides basic Cumulative Flow Diagrams based on the movement of cards between
        <a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> boards. The diagram will start when the board is created,
        and end at either when the board was closed, or at the current time. 15 points are chosen between these times
        when the number of cards in each list at that time is counted. Cards that have been deleted are not shown at all.
